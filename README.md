# sinatra-bootstrap-simple

This is about the simplest demonstration of Sinatra working with Bootstrap.

I was frustrated that all the simple examples that I found had dependency problems, so I thought I'd try to make my own.

Simple to:
* decrease dependencies
* show a reader what is actually required

Included:
* **Gemfile** -- so you know the dependencies
* **Gemfile.lock** -- so you know version that worked for me
* (Twitter) **Bootstrap 3.3.5** - unpacked in public/(css,js,fonts)
* **JQuery 1.11.3** that the Bootstrap examples used - unpacked in public

_Note: I am not an expert. (yet)_

I played with Ruby 1.9, Ruby 2.1, Thin (webserver), and Webrick.  All seemed to work.

### Starting from ground zero

I would install everything as a user, I've been turned off by system installs.
